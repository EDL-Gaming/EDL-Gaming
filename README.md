- 👋 Hi, I’m @EDL-Gaming
- 👀 I’m interested in game design and animation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning video game design and animation, as well as web development
- 💞️ I’m looking to get extra help regarding the subject, I took one term of it at Toronto Film School but could not continue
- 📫 I will be best reached on my discord @EDLGaming#5442.
- I will be uploading as much work as I can as I "finish" projects!
